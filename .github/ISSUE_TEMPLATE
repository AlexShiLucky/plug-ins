In case you encounter problems while using the plug-ins, please consider the following:

* read the documentation pages carefully
* check the [Known issues](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/known-issues/)
* check the [FAQ](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/faq/)
* check the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/forum/) for similar problems
* check the GitHub Issues [tracker](https://github.com/gnuarmeclipse/plug-ins/issues/)

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use cases, if you have custom 
configurations, and generally if you have any experience that you want to share with others, 
use the [GNU ARM Eclipse forum](http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/support/forum/).

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts, use the forum), or you have a 
pertinent suggestion how to enhance the GNU ARM Eclipse plug-ins, continue and register
an issue.

When entering a new issue, be sure you provide:

* plug-in version (sorry, no support for 0.5.x)
* Eclipse version
* Java version
* operating system (sorry, no requests for Win XP 64)
* toolchain version
* the detailed and complete list of steps to reproduce the bug (mandatory)

Please understand that without being able to reproduce the bug we cannot identify your problem.
