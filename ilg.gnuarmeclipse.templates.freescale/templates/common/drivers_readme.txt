These files are provided by Freescale as drivers for their specific devices.

They are not fully CMSIS compliant and some might need to include the
obsolete MemMapPtr_XXX.h header file.

Please note that Freescale does not provide the source code for all
devices drivers, the KLxx sample code packages are quite minimalistic.

If you do not find here a much needed device driver, before filling a 
support ticket to GNU ARM Eclipse, first check if the driver is provided 
by Freescale, in the KLxx sample code package. If it is not there, a
useful idea would be to ask Freescale to provide it.
