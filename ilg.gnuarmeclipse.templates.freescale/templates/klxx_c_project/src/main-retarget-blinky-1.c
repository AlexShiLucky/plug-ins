/*
 * Kinetis $(KLchipFamily) led blink sample (retargetted to semihosting).
 *
 * In debug configurations, demonstrate how to print a greeting message
 * on the standard output. In release configurations the message is
 * simply discarded. By default the trace messages are forwarded to the
 * semihosting output, but can be completely suppressed by changing
 * the definitions in misc/include/trace_impl.h.
 *
 * Then demonstrates how to blink a led with 1Hz, using a
 * continuous loop and SysTick delays.
 *
 * On DEBUG, the uptime in seconds is also displayed on the standard output.
