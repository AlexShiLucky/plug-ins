 * The build does not use startup files, and on Release it does not even use
 * any standard library function (on Debug the printf() brings lots of
 * functions; removing it should also use no other standard lib functions).
 *
 * If the application requires special initialisation code present
 * in some other libraries (for example librdimon.a, for semihosting),
 * define USE_STARTUP_FILES and uncheck the corresponding option in the
 * linker configuration.
