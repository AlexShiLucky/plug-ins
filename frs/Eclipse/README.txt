This folder contains the Eclipse update sites.

The main one is available from:

	http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates

The second one is intended only for tests during development 
and should not be used normally.

Regardless if the plug-in was installed from a downloaded 
archive or via the update site, this is where it'll later on
check for updates.
