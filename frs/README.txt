These are the GNU ARM Eclipse Plug-in download folders:

- Current Releases - the folders containing the history with 
archives with all versions released. This is the place where
you can download the latest version of the plug-in.

- Eclipse - the folders for the automated Eclipse update site
mechanism. This is where Eclipse will go to check for updates.

- Previous Releases & Old Files - archive with very old files.
This is a place where you'll probably find nothing useful...
